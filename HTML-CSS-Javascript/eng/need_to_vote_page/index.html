    Title: Age at election year in Brazil. Do you need to vote?
    Author: Breno D. Chrispim
    Exercise: Simple HTML-Javascript code to compute the user age at the election year in Brazil and if he need to go vote or not. This condition is based on 
    Brazilian law, if someone is 16 years or less old he can not vote, between 16 (includes) and 18 (excluded) he can choose to vote or not, anyone with ages 
    between 18 (included) and 65 (excluded) the vote is mandatory, finally if the person is 65 (included) years or more he can choose to vote or not.
    This code is an suggested exercise of the course PadrÃ£o Web - HTML e CSS from pos-graduation in Desenvolvimento Full Stack e Cloud Computing from Gran University.
